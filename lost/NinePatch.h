/** A NinePatch is a 2D Quad comprised of a connected 3x3 quad matrix.
 * The corners defined by the left/right/top/bottom parameters are not scaled. Everything else is scaled.
 * The outline of the 3x3 quads will be blown up to match the size of the provided rect.
 * The l/r/t/b measurements should be within the range of the raw pixel data of the texture to
 * achieve meaningful results. Everything else is undefined and will probably look messed up.
 * The specified rect is treated as pixel coordinates in a 2d coordinate system.
 * l,r,t,b are cap sizes in pixels.
 * 0,0 is the bottom left corner.
