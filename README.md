LostEngine 2
===
A simple library for OpenGL based applications, aiming for a OpenGL ES 2.0 compatible subset and cross-plattform compatibility. 
* uses OpenGL ES 2.0 compatible subset of OpenGL
* helper classes for resource loading and lifecycle management: bitmaps, textures, fonts, shaders
* font rendering: text is rendered into meshes that use dynamically generated textures of packed glyphs
* basic shader preprocessor that allows usage of include directives 
* minimized dependencies: no boost, bitmap loading via stb_image, font rendering via stb_truetype, 
* supported platforms: mac
